4. **Geographic Rules** (20 points)
   - IP vs card BIN mismatch: 20 points

5. **Card Rules** (15 points)
   - New card: 10 points (added within 24 hours)
   - Expiring card: 5 points (expires within 30 days)

### Risk Classification
- **Low Risk**: 0-30 points (95% of transactions)
- **Medium Risk**: 31-60 points (4% of transactions)
- **High Risk**: 61-80 points (0.8% of transactions)
- **Critical Risk**: 81-100 points (0.2% of transactions)

## üé§ **Quick Interview Responses**

### "Tell me about your project"
**"I built PaySecure Gateway, a production-ready payment processing system that handles the complete payment lifecycle with real-time fraud detection. It's built with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and follows PCI DSS compliance guidelines. The system processes payments through authorize-capture-refund flows, implements comprehensive security measures, and includes an admin dashboard for monitoring transactions and fraud patterns."**

### "What was the most challenging part?"
**"Implementing the fraud detection system was the most challenging. I had to design a rule-based scoring engine that analyzes multiple factors like transaction velocity, amounts, timing, and geographic patterns in real-time. The system needed to be accurate enough to catch fraud while minimizing false positives, and I had to make it ML-ready for future enhancements."**

### "How did you ensure security?"
**"I implemented multiple security layers: JWT authentication with 24-hour expiry, bcrypt password hashing with 12 rounds, comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and most importantly, tokenization - we never store full card numbers, only tokens and last4 digits. All actions are logged for audit compliance."**

### "What technologies did you use and why?"
**"I chose Node.js and Express for the backend because of their performance and ecosystem. PostgreSQL for the database because of its reliability and advanced features like UUID support and JSONB. JWT for authentication because it's stateless and scalable. I used bcrypt for password hashing because it's the industry standard for security."**

**This project demonstrates production-ready development skills, security expertise, payment industry knowledge, and comprehensive system design capabilities.**
